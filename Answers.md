- Discuss the differences among the results. Does the starting point make a difference?  
By adding all the different edges that existed between the given countries, there appeared a total of 4 colors 
distinguishing them. Including Bolivia as a starting point as well allowed for 4 separate colors to be used. The 
orders of `breadthFirst`, `closestFirst`, and `depthFirst` were all the same regardless, except for the fact that 
the starting point differed. The output of `randomWalk` was the same nonetheless as each time, the outcome would 
be randomly generated and countries would be revisited.  

- Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.  
A real-world map might have several different colors to distinguish certain aspects of the map, like borders, 
population size, altitude, climate, currency type and more.
